## RandomForest-LP-

### For this project I have publicly explored available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor I would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.So I have tried to create a model that will help predict this.

### Classifier Used:RandomForest Classifier,Decisiontree Classifier.

### Prediction And Evaluation:
                precision   recall  f1-score   support

     0          0.85      1.00      0.92      2431
     1          0.56      0.02      0.04       443

avg/total       0.80      0.85     0.78      2874

### Confusion Matrix(y_test,predictions):
